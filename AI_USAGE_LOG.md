Interaction 1: Scaffolding the Initial Project Structure
Context: Before writing code, I wanted a well-organized directory structure that separates concerns, anticipating future complexity.
My Prompt (Engineer's Prompt): Design a Go API project structure following Clean Architecture principles. Show me a directory tree and briefly explain the roles of/cmd,/internal/api(for handlers),/internal/domain, and/internal/service.
AI Suggestion: The AI provided a good starting structure, including /pkg which is often debated. It put database logic directly in a top-level /internal/repository directory.
My Action: Modified. The structure was overly complex for this assignment. I simplified it by merging the repository/service layers for this specific use case and completely removed the /pkg directory, as all my code would be private to this single module. The AI's suggestion was a good textbook example, but I adapted it to fit the project's actual scope.

Interaction 2: Creating the HTTP Handler with Middleware
Context: I needed the main HTTP handler for /api/search-query, but I also knew I'd need CORS middleware immediately for the frontend.
My Prompt (Engineer's Prompt): Generate a Go HTTP handler function for a POST endpoint. It should be wrapped in a separate CORS middleware function that sets "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" to "*". The handler itself should just decode a simple JSON request body for now.
AI Suggestion: The AI generated a working handler and a separate middleware function. However, the middleware was verbose and didn't handle the pre-flight OPTIONS request, which is a common oversight.
My Action: Modified. I accepted the basic structure but manually added logic to the middleware to specifically handle r.Method == "OPTIONS" by writing a 200 OK header and returning early. This prevents bugs with browser pre-flight checks.

Interaction 3: Testable AI Client Refactoring
Context: My first draft of the AI client made a direct API call, which I knew was untestable. I needed to refactor it using Dependency Injection.
My Prompt (Engineer's Prompt): Refactor this Go function to be testable. It directly creates a Gemini client. I want to use dependency injection. Define a small interface that contains only the methods my function needs from the client. Then, modify the function to accept that interface as an argument.
(I pasted the initial, untestable code)
AI Suggestion: The AI correctly created an interface and modified the function to accept it. However, it named the interface GeminiClientInterface, which is a common anti-pattern in Go (interfaces shouldn't be named after their implementation).
My Action: Refactored and Renamed. I accepted the core refactoring but renamed the interface to GenerativeModel to describe what it does, not what it is, which is idiomatic Go. A small but important change for code quality.

Interaction 4: Debugging a Subtle defer Bug
Context: I had created a realModelFactory function to produce my AI client, but my API calls were failing with a "connection closed" error. I suspected a lifecycle issue.
My Prompt (Engineer's Prompt): In this Go function, I create a new Gemini client and return the model from it. But my calls are failing. I suspect thedefer client.Close()is executing too early. Is that correct? Explain why and provide the corrected code.
(I pasted the factory function with the incorrect defer)
AI Suggestion: The AI correctly identified the bug. It explained that defer schedules the call to run when the current function returns, not when the program exits. This meant the client was being closed immediately after being created. It provided the corrected code with the defer line removed.
My Action: Accepted. The AI's diagnosis and explanation were perfect. This confirmed my suspicion and provided the fix, saving me debugging time.

Interaction 5: Writing a Robust JSON Extraction Function
Context: The AI API was inconsistently wrapping its JSON response in markdown fences. My initial strings.Index approach was too brittle.
My Prompt (Engineer's Prompt): Write a Go function that takes a raw string from an LLM and extracts a JSON object. The function must be robust enough to handle cases where the JSON is wrapped in \``json ... ```, cases where there's conversational text before the first '{', and cases where there is no JSON at all.]`
AI Suggestion: The AI provided a function that used strings.TrimPrefix for the markdown fence and then strings.Index for the first brace. This was better but still not perfect.
My Action: Modified. I found the AI's suggestion could still fail in some edge cases. I rejected the initial implementation and asked for a follow-up: That's a good start, but what if there's text after the final curly brace? Modify it to find the first '{' and the *last* '}' to create the slice. The AI then provided the improved version, which I accepted.

Interaction 6: Optimizing Frontend State
Context: My React component had multiple useState calls for isLoading, error, and data. This is fine, but can become messy. I wanted to consolidate them.
My Prompt (Engineer's Prompt): Refactor these three useState hooks in React into a single useReducer hook. Define the reducer function to handle actions for 'FETCH_START', 'FETCH_SUCCESS', and 'FETCH_ERROR'.
AI Suggestion: The AI correctly generated the useReducer implementation, including the initial state object, the reducer function with a switch statement, and how to dispatch the actions inside my handleSearch function.
My Action: Accepted. This was a great suggestion for improving code quality. Using useReducer makes state transitions more explicit and predictable, which is a pattern favored by experienced React developers.

Interaction 7: Rejecting a Poor Test Suggestion
Context: I asked the AI to write a test for my database module.
My Prompt (Engineer's Prompt): Write a Go unit test for my SaveSearch function. It should verify that a record is inserted into an in-memory SQLite database.
AI Suggestion: The AI generated a test that wrote a record and then read it back to check one field. However, it didn't clean up the test database file afterwards, meaning test runs would interfere with each other. It also didn't assert all fields of the struct.
My Action: Rejected and Rewrote. I rejected the initial suggestion because it was not a "clean" test. I rewrote it myself, adding a TestMain function with setup() and teardown() to create and delete the database file for each run. I also added assertions for every field in the returned struct to make the test more thorough.

Interaction 8: Generating a GitHub Actions CI Workflow
Context: I wanted to add a basic CI pipeline to automatically run tests on every push.
My Prompt (Engineer's Prompt): Generate a GitHub Actions workflow file. It should trigger on push to the 'main' branch. It needs two parallel jobs: one for the backend that runs 'go test', and one for the frontend that runs 'npm install' and 'npm test'. Also, show how to use matrix testing to run the backend job against two Go versions: 1.21 and 1.22.
AI Suggestion: The AI provided a nearly perfect YAML file. It set up the parallel jobs, the checkout steps, and the commands. It correctly implemented the strategy.matrix for the Go versions.
My Action: Accepted. This was a huge time-saver. Writing CI YAML files from scratch is tedious and error-prone. The AI's output was immediately usable.
