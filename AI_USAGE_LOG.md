Interaction 1: Initial Backend Server Setup
Context: I needed to create the initial Golang backend server. I wanted a simple, idiomatic server using the standard net/http library, including a basic health check endpoint.
My Prompt: Create a basic Golang web server using the net/http package. It should listen on port 8080 and have a /api/health endpoint that returns a JSON object {"status": "ok"}.
AI Suggestion: The assistant generated a complete main.go file. It included the main function, the http.HandleFunc for the health check, proper JSON content-type headers, and the http.ListenAndServe call with error handling.
My Action: Accepted. The generated code was exactly what I needed. It was clean, followed Go conventions, and provided a perfect starting point for the project.
Interaction 2: Database Module with SQLite
Context: I needed to create the persistence layer for the application using SQLite. I wanted a module that would initialize the database and provide a function to save search history records securely.
My Prompt: Write a Go module for an SQLite database. It needs an InitDB function that takes a file path and creates a "search_history" table if it doesn't exist. Also, create a SaveSearch function that takes a SearchHistory struct and saves it to the database using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
AI Suggestion: The AI provided the full code for internal/database/database.go. It included the SearchHistory struct, the InitDB function with the correct CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS SQL statement, and a SaveSearch function that correctly used db.Prepare() and stmt.Exec() for security.
My Action: Accepted. The code was excellent. Using prepared statements is a critical security practice, and the AI implemented it correctly without me having to specify every detail. This saved significant time.
Interaction 3: Debugging a Go Module Error
Context: After creating the database module, I tried to run go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3 and encountered an error. I wasn't sure what was wrong.
My Prompt: (I pasted the full error message into the AI chat)
Generated code
go: go.mod file not found in current directory or any parent directory.
'go get' is no longer supported outside a module.
To build and install a command, use 'go install' with a version...
Use code with caution.
AI Suggestion: The AI immediately diagnosed the problem. It explained that modern Go projects require a go.mod file to manage dependencies and that I needed to initialize a Go module first. It provided the exact command to fix it: go mod init <module-name>.
My Action: Accepted. I ran go mod init ai-knowledge-base as suggested, which created the go.mod file. Afterwards, the go get command worked perfectly. The AI's explanation was clear and its solution was precise.
Interaction 4: Frontend Test Script Configuration
Context: I had written my first frontend test with Vitest but running npm test failed with an error.
My Prompt: (Pasted the error message)
Generated code
npm ERR! Missing script: "test"
Use code with caution.
AI Suggestion: The assistant explained that the default Vite package.json does not include a "test" script. It told me to open package.json, find the "scripts" section, and add a new entry: "test": "vitest".
My Action: Accepted. I edited the package.json file exactly as suggested. This resolved the error and allowed my frontend test suite to run.
Interaction 5: Refactoring for Testability (Dependency Injection)
Context: My initial ai_client.go file created the Gemini client directly inside the GetAIAnswer function. I knew this would be hard to test, so I wanted to refactor it using professional design patterns.
My Prompt: I have this Go function that calls the Gemini API directly. I want to make it testable without making real network calls. Can you refactor it using an interface and dependency injection so I can mock the AI model during tests?
(I then pasted the initial, non-testable version of the ai_client.go code).
AI Suggestion: The AI provided a complete and masterful refactoring. It introduced a GenerativeAIModel interface, split the logic into a public-facing function (GetAIAnswer) and a testable internal function (getAIAnswerInternal), and used a "factory" pattern to inject the dependency. This new structure completely decoupled my application logic from the external API client.
My Action: Accepted and Studied. This was the most valuable interaction. The suggested pattern was exactly the best-practice solution for this problem. It elevated the quality of the project significantly.
Interaction 6: Writing the Corresponding Mock and Test
Context: After the refactoring, I needed to write the actual test code that used the new, testable structure.
My Prompt: Now, using the refactored ai_client.go code you just gave me, show me how to write the test file for it. Create a mockAIModel that satisfies the interface and write a test for the success case of the getAIAnswerInternal function.
AI Suggestion: The assistant generated the complete ai_client_test.go file. It included the mockAIModel struct with the interface methods implemented, and a full test function (TestGetAIAnswerInternal_Success) that configured the mock, injected it via the mock factory, and asserted the results.
My Action: Accepted. The test code was perfect. It demonstrated exactly how the dependency injection pattern pays off, allowing for a fast, reliable, and isolated unit test.
Interaction 7: Crafting the Final Gemini Prompt
Context: I needed to create the final, robust prompt to send to the Gemini API. I wanted to ensure the output was consistently a valid JSON object.
My Prompt: Create a detailed prompt for the Gemini 1.5 Flash model. It should act as an IT support assistant. Tell it to answer a user's question based only on a provided list of knowledge base articles. Crucially, instruct it that its entire response must be a single, valid JSON object with the keys "ai_summary_answer" and "ai_relevant_articles", with no other text like "Here is the JSON you requested."
AI Suggestion: The AI produced an excellent, multi-part prompt template. It included a role description ("You are an expert IT support assistant..."), a clear constraint ("based ONLY on the provided..."), placeholders for the articles and user query, and very explicit instructions about the JSON output format.
My Action: Accepted and Integrated. I used the suggested template as the basis for my buildPrompt function. The explicit instruction about the output format was key to making the response parsing reliable.
